            <h1>COMPX223 Intro and Project Guide</h1>
            <img src="../../images/data-prev.png" alt="COMPX223 Project" class="project-image">
            <p>The COMPX223 project involved comprehensive work with database management and application development using tools like SQL Server Management Studio, Database Manager, and Visual Studio. The projectâ€™s primary goal was to develop a robust database system for managing user data, including login, registration, and session tracking. The process included creating and managing databases, designing and implementing tables, and writing SQL queries to handle data insertion, updates, and retrieval. The project also encompassed building a C# application that interacted with the database, enabling functionalities like user login, registration, and session management.</p>
            <p>The project provided valuable hands-on experience with database design and management, as well as practical skills in integrating databases with applications. Working with SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio allowed me to deepen my understanding of database operations and application development. This experience enhanced my ability to handle real-world data management tasks and develop functional, user-oriented software solutions. The project was instrumental in developing my technical skills and understanding of database-driven applications.</p>
            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>In this solo project, I played a central role in creating and managing the database system, including designing tables, writing SQL queries, and implementing a C# application to interact with the database. I developed functionalities for user login, registration, and session management, ensuring that the application effectively handled user data and provided a seamless experience.</p>
            <p>This project honed my skills in database management and application development, and significantly contributed to my understanding of integrating databases with software applications. My efforts were crucial in building a functional and user-oriented system, showcasing my ability to manage data and develop practical software solutions.</p>
