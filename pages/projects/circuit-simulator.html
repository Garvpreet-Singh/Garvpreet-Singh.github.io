            <h1>Digital Circuit Design</h1>
            <img src="../../images/circuits-prev.png" alt="Digital Circuit Design Project" class="project-image">
            <p>The Digital Circuit Design project is a software tool designed to simulate the creation and testing of basic digital circuits. It allows users to build circuits using various logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT, along with input sources and output lamps. The program provides an interactive environment where users can connect these components with wires, simulating real-world digital circuits. A key feature of this project was the refactoring of the initial basic version to incorporate object-oriented principles, specifically inheritance and polymorphism, making it easier to add new components and extend functionality. The program also includes advanced features like evaluating circuit outputs and creating compound circuits by grouping multiple gates, allowing for more complex designs.</p>
            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>In this project, I focused on enhancing the software by implementing inheritance and polymorphism, which streamlined the process of adding new logic gates and components. This involved creating a superclass for the gates, which not only simplified the existing code but also made the program more maintainable and extendable. Additionally, I contributed to the development of the user interface, ensuring that it was intuitive and efficient for users to design and test their circuits. Through this experience, I deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming and learned the importance of writing flexible, scalable code. This project also honed my skills in graphical user interface design, further preparing me for future software development challenges.</p>
