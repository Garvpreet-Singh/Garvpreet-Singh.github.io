            <h1>How Many Elephants?</h1>
            <img src="../../images/HME.png" alt="How Many Elephants Project" class="project-image">
                <p>The "How Many Elephants?" (HME) project is a comprehensive website designed to enhance users' comprehension of number values by providing meaningful context and relatable comparisons. HME achieves this through a combination of unit conversion, reality checking, equivalency calculations, and image creation, making abstract numbers more tangible and easier to understand.</p>
                <p>HME has significant potential in educational settings where students often struggle with grasping large or complex numerical values. By converting, contextualising, and visualising these numbers, HME aids in better comprehension and retention. Additionally, in everyday life, this tool can help individuals make informed decisions by providing a clearer understanding of quantities, whether in finance, cooking, travel, or other practical applications. Overall, HME bridges the gap between abstract numbers and real-world understanding.</p>
                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <p>As a member of the development team, I played a significant role in the creation and implementation of the "Reality Check" feature using Python. This feature utilises the Gemini AI language model to assess the plausibility of user-inputted values in various scenarios. Users can input a scenario, and the system evaluates its realism, promoting critical thinking and helping users develop a better grasp of numerical data in real-world applications.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I was involved in researching and integrating various APIs, such as the Wikibase API and DALL-E API, to enhance the functionality and user experience of the HME project. My efforts contributed to making complex data more accessible and engaging, supporting HMEâ€™s aim of improving numerical literacy and contextual awareness.</p>
