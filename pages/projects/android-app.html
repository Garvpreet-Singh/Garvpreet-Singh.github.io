            <h1>Introduction to Android Project</h1>
            <p>The "Introduction to Android Project" was a comprehensive assignment for COMPX202-242, focusing on creating a responsive Android application. The project involved developing an app that presents information on four topics: About Us, Our People, Outreach, and Research. I designed the app's layout using XML to ensure it was adaptable to different screen sizes and orientations, and I utilized Java for managing UI interactions and data updates. Additionally, I integrated Git for version control to track and manage code changes effectively.</p>
            <p>This project provided valuable hands-on experience in Android app development, including layout design and responsiveness. I learned to handle various screen orientations, use XML for creating dynamic interfaces, and apply Java for managing user interactions. The assignment also enhanced my skills in using Git within Android Studio, reinforcing my understanding of version control and collaborative development practices. Overall, this project deepened my knowledge of Android development and improved my proficiency in version control and UI design.</p>
            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>During this project, I played a key role in developing the app's user interfaces and ensuring they were responsive across different devices and orientations. I implemented clickable image buttons and integrated new activities to display detailed information based on user interactions. I also utilized Git for version control, managing code changes and ensuring a well-organized development process.</p>
            <p>My efforts included designing XML layouts for both portrait and landscape orientations, setting up a new activity for displaying detailed content, and updating the UI using dynamic data from arrays. This project significantly enhanced my skills in Android development and provided a solid foundation in creating responsive, user-friendly applications.</p>
